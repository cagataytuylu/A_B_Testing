# A/B Testing

A/B testing compares two versions of a web page or app against each other to determine 
which one performs better. AB testing is essentially an experiment where two or more 
variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to 
determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal.

With this Project you can compare two different result before and after new alteration and 
can be analysis statisticaly.


## How Do Companies Use A/B Testing?
A/B testing is now used to evaluate everything from website design to online offers to headlines to product descriptions.
Most of these experiments run without the subjects even knowing.
And itâ€™s not just websites. You can test marketing emails or ads as well. For example, you might send two versions of an email to your customer list (randomizing the list first, of course) and figure out which one generates more sales. Then you can just send out the winning version next time. Or you might test two versions of ad copy and see which one converts visitors more often. Then you know to spend more getting the most successful one out there.
