# A/B Testing

A/B testing compares two versions of a web page or app against each other to determine 
which one performs better. AB testing is essentially an experiment where two or more 
variants of a page are shown to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to 
determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal.

With this Project you can compare two different result before and after new alteration and 
can be analysis statisticaly.
